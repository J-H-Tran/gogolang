when the code imports packages contained in other modules, we manage those dependencies through the code's own
module. It is defined by go.mod file that tracks modules that provide those packages. go.mod file stays within
the code, including in source code repo.

Enable dependency tracking: create go.mod file, run `go mod init command`
